	ABSTRACT = {As the basic feature of building, building edges play an important role in many fields such as urbanization monitoring, city planning, surveying and mapping. Building edges detection from high spatial resolution remote sensing (HSRRS) imagery has always been a long-standing problem. Inspired by the recent success of deep-learning-based edge detection, a building edge detection model using a richer convolutional features (RCF) network is employed in this paper to detect building edges. Firstly, a dataset for building edges detection is constructed by the proposed most peripheral constraint conversion algorithm. Then, based on this dataset the RCF network is retrained. Finally, the edge probability map is obtained by RCF-building model, and this paper involves a geomorphological concept to refine edge probability map according to geometric morphological analysis of topographic surface. The experimental results suggest that RCF-building model can detect building edges accurately and completely, and that this model has an edge detection F-measure that is at least 5% higher than that of other three typical building extraction methods. In addition, the ablation experiment result proves that using the most peripheral constraint conversion algorithm can generate more superior dataset, and the involved refinement algorithm shows a higher F-measure and better visual effect contrasted with the non-maximal suppression algorithm.},

	abstract = {Ensemble learning has gained success in machine learning with major advantages over other learning methods. Bagging is a prominent ensemble learning method that creates subgroups of data, known as bags, that are trained by individual machine learning methods such as decision trees. Random forest is a prominent example of bagging with additional features in the learning process. Evolutionary algorithms have been prominent for optimisation problems and also been used for machine learning. Evolutionary algorithms are gradient-free methods that work with a population of candidate solutions that maintain diversity for creating new solutions. In conventional bagged ensemble learning, the bags are created once and the content, in terms of the training examples, are fixed over the learning process. In our paper, we propose evolutionary bagged ensemble learning, where we utilise evolutionary algorithms to evolve the content of the bags in order to iteratively enhance the ensemble by providing diversity in the bags. The results show that our evolutionary ensemble bagging method outperforms conventional ensemble methods (bagging and random forests) for several benchmark datasets under certain constraints. We find that evolutionary bagging can inherently sustain a diverse set of bags without reduction in performance accuracy.}

	abstract = {Vehicle detection technology is of great significance for realizing automatic monitoring and AI-assisted driving systems. The state-of-the-art object detection method, namely, a class of YOLOv5, has often been used to detect vehicles. However, it suffers some challenges, such as a high computational load and undesirable detection rate. To address these issues, an improved lightweight YOLOv5 method is proposed for vehicle detection in this paper. In the presented method, C3Ghost and Ghost modules are introduced into the YOLOv5 neck network to reduce the floating-point operations (FLOPs) in the feature channel fusion process and enhance the feature expression performance. A convolutional block attention module (CBAM) is introduced to the YOLOv5 backbone network to select the information critical to the vehicle detection task and suppress uncritical information, thus improving the detection accuracy of the algorithm. Furthermore, CIoU_Loss is considered the bounding box regression loss function to accelerate the bounding box regression rate and improve the localization accuracy of the algorithm. To verify the performance of the proposed approach, we tested our model via two case studies, i.e., the PASCAL VOC dataset and MS COCO dataset. The results show that the detection precision of the proposed model increased 3.2%, the FLOPs decreased 15.24%, and the number of model parameters decreased 19.37% compared with those of the existing YOLOv5. Through case studies and comparisons, the effectiveness and superiority of the presented approach are demonstrated.}

	ABSTRACT = {Object detection is an important process in surveillance system to locate objects and it is considered as major application in computer vision. The Convolution Neural Network (CNN) based models have been developed by many researchers for object detection to achieve higher performance. However, existing models have some limitations such as overfitting problem and lower efficiency in small object detection. Object detection in remote sensing hasthe limitations of low efficiency in detecting small object and the existing methods have poor localization. Cascade Object Detection methods have been applied to increase the learning process of the detection model. In this research, the Additive Activation Function (AAF) is applied in a Faster Region based CNN (RCNN) for object detection. The proposed AAF-Faster RCNN method has the advantage of better convergence and clear bounding variance. The Fourier Series and Linear Combination of activation function are used to update the loss function. The Microsoft (MS) COCO datasets and Pascal VOC 2007/2012 are used to evaluate the performance of the AAF-Faster RCNN model. The proposed AAF-Faster RCNN is also analyzed for small object detection in the benchmark dataset. The analysis shows that the proposed AAF-Faster RCNN model has higher efficiency than state-of-art Pay Attention to Them (PAT) model in object detection. To evaluate the performance of AAF-Faster RCNN method of object detection in remote sensing, the NWPU VHR-10 remote sensing data set is used to test the proposed method. The AAF-Faster RCNN model has mean Average Precision (mAP) of 83.1% and existing PAT-SSD512 method has the 81.7%mAP in Pascal VOC 2007 dataset.},

	ABSTRACT = {In remote sensing images, small objects have too few discriminative features, are easily confused with background information, and are difficult to locate, leading to a degradation in detection accuracy when using general object detection networks for aerial images. To solve the above problems, we propose a remote sensing small object detection network based on the attention mechanism and multi-scale feature fusion, and name it AMMFN. Firstly, a detection head enhancement module (DHEM) was designed to strengthen the characterization of small object features through a combination of multi-scale feature fusion and attention mechanisms. Secondly, an attention mechanism based channel cascade (AMCC) module was designed to reduce the redundant information in the feature layer and protect small objects from information loss during feature fusion. Then, the Normalized Wasserstein Distance (NWD) was introduced and combined with Generalized Intersection over Union (GIoU) as the location regression loss function to improve the optimization weight of the model for small objects and the accuracy of the regression boxes. Finally, an object detection layer was added to improve the object feature extraction ability at different scales. Experimental results from the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) dataset VisDrone2021 and the homemade dataset show that the AMMFN improves the APs values by 2.4% and 3.2%, respectively, compared with YOLOv5s, which represents an effective improvement in the detection accuracy of small objects.},

	abstract = {Backpropagation (BP) algorithm is one of the most basic learning algorithms in deep learning. Although BP has been widely used, it still suffers from the problem of easily falling into the local minima due to its gradient dynamics. Inspired by the fact that the learning of real brains may exploit chaotic dynamics, we propose the chaotic backpropagation (CBP) algorithm by integrating the intrinsic chaos of real neurons into BP. By validating on multiple datasets (e.g. cifar10), we show that, for multilayer perception (MLP), CBP has significantly better abilities than those of BP and its variants in terms of optimization and generalization from both computational and theoretical viewpoints. Actually, CBP can be regarded as a general form of BP with global searching ability inspired by the chaotic learning process in the brain. Therefore, CBP not only has the potential of complementing or replacing BP in deep learning practice, but also provides a new way for understanding the learning process of the real brain.}
